<div class=split-bio>
<p>Jess Illingworth is a singer songwriter from South East Cornwall who writes songs in a folk-pop style. Jess’ sound is focused on crystal clear vocals following catchy melodies, interwoven with creative harmonies and acoustic guitar drives the overall sound. Jess is influenced by Frank Turner’s songwriting and ability to tell a story through music as well as the blend of the folk and pop genres in music by Maisie Peters and Gabrielle Aplin.</p>
<p>Jess began learning the acoustic guitar at the age of 17 when she received one as a birthday present from her parents; she is self-taught and learned to play the guitar by watching covers on youtube. Since then she has also been known to dabble with the mandolin and keyboard. Jess has been writing her own material since her late teens and her lyrics often have an introspective focus. Jess enjoys combining thoughtful lyrics with more playful melodies and sounds.</p>
<p>Jess was chosen to play at Boardmasters festival from 2014-2018 and played pub gigs whilst at university. Since graduating in September 2020, Jess has been focusing on writing her own material and recording demos and covers from home. In recent weeks, Jess has recorded her first single at a studio in Cornwall and is looking forward to continuing to record her own music.</p>
